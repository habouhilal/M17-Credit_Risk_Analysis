# M17-Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview 

This project is about machine learning. The analysis consist of using different techniques to predict Credit risk. First, we trained and evaluated models with unbalanced classes. We also used imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using resampling.
Using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, we first oversample the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms and undersample the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. Then, we used a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm. Next, youâ€™ll compare two new machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk. At last, we evaluated the performance of these models.

## Sammury 

In Sammury, the least accurate model was the Cluster Centroid model with a 0.51 balanced accuracy score and a recall of 0.57
The best performing models are the BalancedRandomForestClassifier and the EasyEnsembleClassifier. EasyEnsembleClassifier had the highest balanced accuracy score at 0.925 and a recall of 0.94, with BalancedRandomForestClassifier coming in with the second best scores in these two categories. 



The precision did not differ significantly between any of the methods, with all averageing 0.99. Of any of these models, EasyEnsembleClassifier would be the recommendation, followed by BalancedRandomForestClassifier.
